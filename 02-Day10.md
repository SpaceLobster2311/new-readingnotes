# Chapter 10: Debugging

## Execution Context and Hoisting

Every time a script enters a new execution context, there are 2 phases. 

1. Prepare
  * A new scope is created
  * Variables, functions, arguments are created

2. Execute
  * Now the script assigns values to variables
  * Reference functions and run their code
  * Execute Statements
  
  ### Hoisting:
  
  Call functions before they are declared
  assign a value to a variable that hasn't been declared. 
  
  ### Understadning scope
  
  Functions in Javascript have lexical scope and are linked to the object they were defined in. 
  
  ### Different error objects
  
  When an error object is created it contains the following properties
  
  * name - type of error
  * message - description 
  * file Number
  * line Number
  
 There are 7 types of error objects
 
 * Error
 *SyntaxError
 *Reference Error
 *Type Error
 * Range Error
 * URI Error
 * Eval Error
 
 ### How to deal with errors
 
 **Debugging Workflow**
 
 Where is the problem?
 
 * Look at error message
 * Check how far script is running
 * Use breakpoints where things go wrong
 
 What exactly is the problem?
 
 * When you have set breakpoints, yo can see if the variables around them have the expected values. If not, you are on to something
 * Break down parts of code to test small pieces
 * Check the number of parameters for a function or number of items in an array
