# Chapter 3: Lists

Ordered Lists use (ol)

Unordered Lists use (ul)

both use (li) for their listing while in the tags

Definition lists use (dl) 
The definition term used (dt) while the definition itself uses (dd)

You can use nested lists with (ul) inside of a (li) tag

## Chapter 13: Boxes

Box dimensins are determined by width and height in CSS. 

You can limit witdth and height with min-width, max-width, min-height, max-height. 

#### Overflowing content

You can use the overflow: tag to assign properties to text that doesn't fit within the box. 

The hidden property will hide content that doesn't fit in the box. 

the scroll tag will add a scrollbar to allow the user to scroll down the text that doesn't fit within the box. 

### Border, Margin, Padding

Every Box has a border even if its 0px

You can set border width the border-width tag

border-style will allow you to adjust the way the edges of the border look

border-color will adjust its color value

border-radious will allow you to make the edges rounded. You can also set a pixel density for it

Margin sits outside the edge of the border and setting the width will create space between the borders of adjacent boxes. 

you can specify the margins with pixels and the commands:

margin-top

margin-bottom

margin-left

margin-right

Padding is the space between the border and the content WITHIN the box. 

You can specify the padding with pixels and the commands:

padding-left

padding-right

padding-bottom

padding-left

You can center content by having the left and right margins set to auto

## Chaper 2 from JS book. 

Creating basic arrays. 

array = []

index 0 is the first item in the array. 

You can access items in an array with array[1] as an example 


### Chapter 4: decisions and loops

Using if/else statements - if (conditions) are met then run {specified code} 

Switch statments are similar but can be more efficient. 

Truthy and Falsy values:

Fasly values can be (false, 0, NaN, and empty string, a variable with no value assigned to it.)

Truthy values can be (true, 1, a string with content, number calculations, true written as a string, zero written as a string, false written as a string)

Loops:
for loops: Will run as long as conditions are met.  They generally repeat until the condition can no longer run the cylce. 

While loops will run as long as a specific condition are met.
