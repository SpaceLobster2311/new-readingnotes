### Expressions

Expressions evaluate into a single value. There are generally two types of expressions

1. Expressions that assign a value to a variable
2. Expressions that use 2 or more values to return a single value

### Operators

Expressions rely on operators to create a single value from one or more values. 

* Assignment Operators: color = 'blue'
* Arithmetic Operators: area = 3 * 2
* String Operators: greeting = "hi ' + 'Alex'
* Comparison Operators: buy = 3 > 5; (This will return as false) 
* Logical Operators: buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); (Value is now true)
