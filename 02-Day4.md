Lecture 4: 
* Demonstrate how to use js keywords 'let' and 'const'. 
* Demonstrate how functions work in js
* Demonstrate understanding of the CSS layout principles
* Be able to successfuly pair program

Let and const are ways of declaring variables. 

When in doubt *let* it out. 

Constants cannot be changed once it is declared. 

DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

Functions 
* A huge benefit is it is a single source of truth. Changing the function once will change it everywhere

Vocab
* parameter: the () at the end of the function. You can place something in the () to delcare the parameter
* arguemnt: the specifc when we call the funciton
* Helper function is a function ran inside another function

### Expressions

Expressions evaluate into a single value. There are generally two types of expressions

1. Expressions that assign a value to a variable
2. Expressions that use 2 or more values to return a single value

### Operators

Expressions rely on operators to create a single value from one or more values. 

* Assignment Operators: color = 'blue'
* Arithmetic Operators: area = 3 * 2
* String Operators: greeting = "hi ' + 'Alex'
* Comparison Operators: buy = 3 > 5; (This will return as false) 
* Logical Operators: buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); (Value is now true)

## Chapter 15: Jquery Documentation

JQuery is a Javascript Library. It is a JS file that when included with your page allows you to use the functions, objects and properties it contains. 

Ajax is a technique for loading data into a part of the webpage without having to refresh the entire page. 
1. What does AJAX do? Things like autofill, adding to cart etc. 

Ajax speeds up user experience. 

How AJAX *works*
1. The Request - the browser requests information from the server. 
2. The server responds with data. *(Usually html,xml,json)*
3. The Response - browser processes the content and adds it to the paige. 

JSON stands for Javascript object notation


### Pair Programming

* 2 developers share a single workstation to tackle code problems together. 
* Often consists of a **Driver** and a **Navigator**
  1. Driver is the programmer who types
  2. Navigator uses words to guide driveer but doesnt actually type.
