# Understanding the Problem Domain 

Identifying the problem domain and working exclusivly in that aspect allows the programmer to stay focused on the problem. 

By mastering the basic problem domain you will open up yourself to tackle more complx problems and use cases. 

Once the difficulty of the problem domain is removed, learning becomes much easier. 

Practice the fundamentals and concepts of a problem before tackling more advanced features or use cases. 


## Chapter 3: Object Literals

**What is an object?**

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you may recognize in the real world. 

In an object:

Variables become properties-

properties tell us about the object - such as name of hotel or how many rooms it has

Functions become methods -

methods represent tasks associated with the object. - ex: Checking how many rooms are available by subtracting the number of booked rooms from the total number of rooms. 

var Hotel{

Properties:
* NAME - string
* rooms - number
* booked - number
* gym - boolean (yes or no)
* room types -array

Methods:
checkAvailability - function 
};

Creating objects: Literal Notation 
The easiest way to create an object. 

var hotel = {
name: 'myHotel',
room: 50,
booked: 30,

checkAvailability: function() {
  return this.rooms - this.booked;
  }
  };

You can access properties or methods of an object by using dot notation. 

You can also access properties using square brackets

To access a property or method of an object, 

use the name of the object followed by a period then the property or method you want to access. 

EX:

    var hotelName = hotel.name; - object.property

    var roomsFree = hotel.checkavailability(); - object.method
    
If a website had 1000 hotels, they could all use the same object with minor changes to display the same data model. 

### Chaoter 5: Document Object Model

The DOM tree is a model of a web page. 
DOM = Document Object Model.

Accessing elements:

* getElementById('id') - can search enitre document and return individual elements. 
* querySelector ('css se;ector') - can search enitre document and return individual elements. 
* getElementByClassName('class')
* getElementByTagName('tagname')
* quertSelectorAll('css selector')

You can traverse the DOM using nodes

There are many ways to traverse and manipulate DOM's. 
Pages 183-242 in the JS book have in depth notations for each.
