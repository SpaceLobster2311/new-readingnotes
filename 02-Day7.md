# HTML Tables

Basic Table Structure
The (table) element is used to create the table. 

The (tr) is used to indicate the start of each row using the opening tr tag. At the end of the row you use the (/tr) tag. 

The (td) tag is used to represent each cell in the table row. Each cell is closed off with a (/td) tag.

The table heading tag (th) is used to represent the heading for either the column or row. 

Even if a cell has no content it should have a (th) tag otherwise the table will not render correctly. 

The colspan element indicates how many columns the cell should run across. (td colspan="3")dog(/td).

The rowspan element is the same thing but for rows. (td rowspan="2")Cat(/td).

(thead) (tbody) and (tfoot) distinguish between the head, body, and footers of tables. 

Object notation:
var hotel = {
hotel.name = Inn,
hotel.rooms = 40,
}

object constructor notation:
var hotel = new object {};

you can then feed the constructor parameters to create new objects with different and similar properties quickly. 

"this" is an important keyword. It is used for the objects that are created. It is also used for calling the properties inside objects outsdie of them and inside. 

Arrays area actually a special type of object. They hold a related set of key/pair values. But the key is an index number for each value. 

Arrays can hold objects, and objects can hold arays. This allows you to make more complex data structures. 


## Domain modeling

This link is a great resource for basic object oriented programming. 

Tips from the summary of the website. (Copy and Pasted for accuracy) 

* When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
* Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
* Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
* Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
* Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
* Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
