# CSS Layout Chapter 15 review

Css treats each HTML elements as if it is in its own box. 

**Block Line elements start on a new line**

**Inline elements flow between surrounding text**

If one block line element sits inside another block line element, the outer box is known as the **parent** or **containing** element. 

CSS has thre positioning schemes to allow you to control the layout of the page. 

1. Noraml flow - Every block element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down on the page than the previous one. 

2. Relative Positioning - This moves an element from the position it would be in noraml flow, shifting it either top, down, left or right. Everything 
in the surrounding elements stays the same. 

3. Absolute positioning - This positions the element in relation to its containing element. 

**Floating Elements** allow you to take an element in a normal position and push it as far left or right of the containing element as possible. 

A **z-index** will help with overlapping elements by allowing you to scroll. Keeping a clearer page. 

Adjusting pixel sizes is important for the varied sizes of screens accessing the webpage. 

A liquid layout uses percentages to specify width so that the design will fit to different size screens
