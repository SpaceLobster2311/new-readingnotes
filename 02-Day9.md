#Forms:

How forms work -

a user fills in a form then presses a button to submit informationn to the server.  

A form can have several different controls.  Each gathersd different information for the server. 

Every form requires the (form) element. Its value is the url for the page on the server that will recieve the info when it is submitted. 

Forms can be sent using 1 of 2 methods: *get* or *post*

With the method, the values from the forms are added to the end of the URL speficied in the action attribute.  

The get method is good for short forms (like search boxes) and when you are retreiving data from a web server. 

The post method is should be used to

allow users to upload a file, inout is very long, contains sensitive data, and adding info to a database. 

(input) ie text input

When the type attribute is set to "text" is creates a single line of text input. 

Quick summary:

Whenever you want to collect info from visitos on forms, you need a (form) element.

Information in forms is set in key/value pairs

Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types are sent to the server. 

HTML5. introduces new form elements to make the process easier.
