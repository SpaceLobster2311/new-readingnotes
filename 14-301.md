# Diversity

In the 80's computers were seen as a boys hobby. 
This disparity grew because families would buy boys computers, but girls would not get them. 
By college time it created a gap between the computer literate which was also a gendered gap. 
Progress is being made to reverse this. 

1. The rise of the personal computer
2. Those who are more computer literate tend to have an easier time getting into programming at a young age, and thus becoming a dominate player in the tech world.
