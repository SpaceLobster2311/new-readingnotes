# The difference between PUT and PATCH

PUT - The PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified versionn of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource. 

The PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource - wikipedia.

Swagger - simulates a request from the front end to the back end. To see if you're successfully calling. 

APIDOC - It looks like apiDOC creates API annotations from within your source code. 

Swagger is an online tool, apiDoc is used in the code. 

## SOAP vs REST API

Soap stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. It was originally developed to replace older technology.

SOAP has built in error handling.

REST relies on a URL.  Rest uses GET POST PUT and DELETE. 

SOAP +'s 
* Standardized
* Build in error handling
* Automation with certain products

REST +'s
* Easier to use
* No tools required to interact with the web services
* small learning curve
* Efficient
* Fast

### What is a web server?

On the hardware side it's a computer that stores web server software and a websites component files

On the software side, it includes parts that control how web users access hosted files.

### What is express?

Express is a node.js application framework that provides features for web and mobile aps. including API's and a featureset to access them. 

### The WRRC 

Is the web request response cycle.

From a client pining a request, to a response from the server, back to the client. 

### Routing

A specific URL output to tell the the front end where to hot the back end. 


## Day 2 Lecture notes

**Express**

How it works - 

2 main features -

1. Routing 

How does express know which callbck/function to use when a request is made?


2. Middlewares - a function that runs between others functions. 

The function parameters and operations that express can use. 

Express's job is to find a function, to send a response back.  

Express needs to define a method and a route. 

If it receives a request from the specific route, it will run the function. 

So if it recieves a GET request and the correct route of ex: /dogs

it'll run the function it has.  

app.use method can be used if a request comes in that doesn't fit the the other methods like GET. 

app.use should be used at the bottom of the code to catch anything that was missed. It's an application route, as wehre a app.get is a method route. 

The order of the handlers matters.

You can add next as a third param in the app.use method to have the request move on to the next thing. 

then place next(); in the function. 

If you pass anything into a next() param it is considered an error. 
(err, req, res, next) and the next(err) will fill in that first part? The err will only get triggered if something is passed into next();

If you don't call next it'll get stuck or send back the response. 

to check for auth its req.headers.authorization -> not sure if that's how it always is. 

a function that is running in between a bunch of other functions is middleware.  It's anything that uses that next(); pretty much anything that passes the baton off to another function after doing something. 

Yuo can place middlewaresin different files and call the files in to the main server.js. So instead of changing a ton of stuff, you can break it down to bite size and change within files. - This is called using application level middleware. 





#### Error Handling

You can place an app.use at the bottom of the server.js to send back an error that no other routes were hit. 

You can use a star fir the first param with the bottom app.use to check all routes. 


### Tests

**How to test the middleware** 

create the __tests__ folder

within create a middleware.test.js

describe('testing middleware functions, () => {

test('test stuff', () => {

})

})


make sure to update package.json for tests
