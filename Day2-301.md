## State and Lifecycle

**Converting a function to a class**

* Create an ES6 class with the same name that extends React.Component
* Add an empty method to it called render()
* Move the body of the function within the render method
* Replace props with this.props in the render() body
* delete remaining empty function delcaration.

**Adding a local state to a Class**
* reaplce this.props.date with this.state.date in the render() method.
* Add a class constructor that assigns the initial this.state
* remove date prop from element


## Handling events in React

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string

EX HTML
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>

EX React

<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>

**Passing arguments into event handlers**
You just need (A,B)

### Conditional Rendering 
You can set conditions by using if statements to decide when things can render. 
You can use variables to store elements
