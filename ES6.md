classes are self-contained objects

They allow for ease of use 

A class object can contain a constructor and its prototype methods and be called and created easily. 

JS objects use prototype based inheritnace.  It is a similar design to class inheritance in languages like Java or C#. 

Basiclly, when methods or properties are attached to an object's prototype they can be used for the obect and its descendants.
