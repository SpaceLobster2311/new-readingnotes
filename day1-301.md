# React Tutorial - Passing data thru props


A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. Specifically the render returns a React Element.

JSX comes with the full power of JavaScript. You can put any JavaScript expressions within braces inside JSX. 

Each React element is a JavaScript object that you can store in a variable or pass around in your program.

JSX will turn the <div /> syntax into a React.createElement ('div') at the time of the build. 

You can refer to an element with html like tags as well. EX: You have a component called ShoppingList, you can refer to the component within your build by writing

<ShoppingList />.  Each react component can operate independantly, this allows you to build complex Ui's from simple components. 

For react to remember things, componenents use 'state' 

React components can have state by setting this.state in their constructors. 

this.state should be considered as private to a React component that it's defined in. 

In JS classes you always need to call super when defining a constructor of a subclass. All react components that have a constructor should start with a 

super(props) call. 

Important note about multiple children: 
**To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other, you need to declare the shared state in their parent component instead.** 

**The parent component can pass the state back down to the children by using props;**

**this keeps the child components in sync with each other and with the parent component.**

## Rendering Elements

An element describes what you see on screen

Unlike browser DOM elements, elements in React are plain objects and are cheap to create. 
React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match React elements. 

Elements are what components are 'made of'

Apps build with just React usually have a single root DOM node.  

To render a React ellement into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render()

### Updating a rendered element

React Elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can't change its children or attributes. 

With this reading, the only way so far to update the UI is to create a new element and pass it to ReactDOM.render()

### Components and Props

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and allows you to work on each piece in isolation. 

*Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.*

Functions and Class Components

Use ES6 class to define the component:

class Example extends React.Component{
  render() {
    return()
    }
}

React is felxible bit has a single strict rule:
**All React Components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.**
