5 differences between SQL and NoSGL

from: https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool
1. SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. 
2. SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
3. SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries
4. SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.
5. SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents.

1. SQL stands for structured query language
2. A relational database is a collection of data that has a predefined relationships between them
3. A verticle structure
4. a plan in the form of an outline or model
5. A noSQL database is a non-relational database. 
6. a NoSQL database is structured horizontally, and adding more servers allows for more power
7. MondgoDB is a NoSQL database program. 
8. It seems as both are useful for different things. 
9. They lack the reliability funcitons that relational databases have.
