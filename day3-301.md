# Lifting State Up

When several components need to share the same changing data, it is recommended to lift the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. 

In React, sharing state is done by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it. This is called "lifting state up"

There should be a "single source of truth" for any data that changes in a React app. 

Ususally the state is first added to the component that needs it for rendering.  Be sure to rely on top-down flow. 

## Lists and Keys

*review how to transform lists in JavaScript*

We can use the map() function to take and array of numbers and change it, then push it into a new output array. 

EX: take a const numbers = [1,2,3]

we can use the map() function with a new const that will run over the array and outpust a new array to the new const. 

EX: const double = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
this will assign [2,4,6] to the double const array we made. 

In React, transforming arrays into lists of elements is nearly identical. 

**Rendering multiple components**

You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}

**Keys**

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.  Keys should be given to elements inside the array to give elements a stable identity.

The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its simblings. Most often you should use ID's from your data as keys.

## The Spread Operator

What is the spread operator?

The spread operator is "..."  it is 3 dots used in the function call.  It 'expands' an iterable object arr into the list of arguments. 

The spread syntax can be used to spread each item in an array into seperate arguemnts to be evaluated. 

The "..." is also useful for 
* Copying an array
* Concatenating or combining arrays
* using math functions
* using an array as arguments
* adding an item to a list
* adding a state to react
* combining objects
* converting NodeList into an array
