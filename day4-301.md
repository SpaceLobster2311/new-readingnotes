# Forms

**Controlled Components**

In HTML, form elements such as input, text area or select maintain their own state and update it based on user input. 

In React they are kept within the state property of components and are updates with setState(). 

**Textarea Tag**

In React, textarea uses a value attribute.  

**The select tag**

"React, instead of using this selected attribute, uses a value attribute on the root select tag. This is more convenient in a controlled component because you only need to update it in one place."

**Handling multiple inputs**

You need to use a name attribute to handle multiple input elements.  This allows the handler function to choose what to do based on the event.target.name

**Controlled Input Null Value**

"Specifying the value prop on a controlled component prevents the user from changing the input unless you desire so. If youâ€™ve specified a value but the input is still editable, you may have accidentally set value to undefined or null."
