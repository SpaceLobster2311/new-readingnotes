# Thinking in React:

**Step 1:** Break up the UI into a component Hierarchy -
 In your outline, draw boxes around every component and subcomponent and give them all names. 
 
 **Step 2:** Build a static Version in React
 
 The next step is to build a static version of your web app in React.  It allows you to decouple the process of programming and setting up a web page into two steps. Creating the layout, then coding the interactivity.
 
 **Step 3:** Identify the minimal (but complete) representation of the UI state. 
 
 From page:
 To build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you’re building a TODO list, keep an array of the TODO items around; don’t keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, take the length of the TODO items array.

**Step 4:** Identify where your state should live.  
 Identify every component that renders something based on that state. 
 
 Use parent component in the heirarchy
 
 **Step 5:** Add inverse Data flow
 
 You need to pass callbacks but up the heirarchy to a funtion that can setState() and allow the app to be updated.
