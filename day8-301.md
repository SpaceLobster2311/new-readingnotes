# Web API Design 

Modern web apps use APIs that clients can use to interact with the application. Two basic points -
1. Platform independence - Any client should be able to call the API regardless of how the API was implemented initially. 
2. Service Evolution - The API should be able to evolve independently from client applications

## Intro to REST

* The primary advantage of REST over HTTP is that it uses open standards and doesnt bind the API or client to any specific implementation. 
* REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data or service that can be accessed by the client. 
* Each resource has an identifier or URI that uniquely defines that resource. 

**GET methods**

A successful GET method returns a HTTP status code of 200.  If the resource cannot be found it will return 404. 

**POST methods**

If a post method creates a new resource it will return 201.  The URI of the new resource will be included in the location header of the response. If the method processes but does not create a new resource it'll return 200.

If the client inputs invalid data it will return a status code of 400. 

**PUT methods**

(from the source)If a PUT method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created), as with a POST method. If the method updates an existing resource, it returns either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). In some cases, it might not be possible to update an existing resource. In that case, consider returning HTTP status code 409 (Conflict).

**Patch methods**

A patch request sends the client a set of updates to an existing resource, in the form of a patch document. The server then processes the patch to perform the update. 

**DELETE methods**
If the delete is successful the web server will respond with a 204 code meaning the process was successful. 

**SuperAgent**

Super Agent is a lightweight progressive ajax API crafted for flexiilty and readability. Supposedly it has an easy learning curve..

It also works with node.js

**Request Basics**

A request can be initaited by invoking the appropriate method on the request of an object, then calling .then() to send the request.

**Regex**

Regex allows us to use regular expressions to filter out data and return specific results.
