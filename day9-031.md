# Concepts of funcitonal programming in Javascript 

1. What is functional programming? 

Functional programming is programming paradigm. A style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathmatical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. 

**Pure functions**
Pure functions return the same result if given the same arguments

They also do not cause any observable side effects. 

If the function reads external files, it's not a pure function. The file's contents can change. 

Any sort of function that relies on RNG is not pure (for obvious reasons)

The benefits of pure functions include easy to test code and reliable data. 

**Immutability**
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed

When data is immutable its state cannot be changed after it is created. 

**High order functions**
High order functions take one or more functions as arguemtns
Or return a function as a result. 

This is where filter, map and reduce belong. They can take funcitons as a paremeter and return them as a result. 

## Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and readability

There is a middle ground between speed and comprehension where good code is written. 

It is important to simplify as well as predict errors that could happen from user input. 

Some strategies include returning early from functions, caching variables and checking for web APIs before implementing own functionality.
