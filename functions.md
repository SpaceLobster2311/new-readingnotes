# Functions
### Functions are very heavily used in development. 

Functions are  agroup of code that get "called" whenever it is needed. 

The code is seperated out into groups of instructions
then you call the instructions in the order they need to be done

ex. 
function sayHello(*parameter*){

*//this is the where you will say hello*

  console.log('hello from my function')
  
}

** functions will always have () but if u have a parameter it will be in between the ()

A function signature consist of fucntion - name of fucntion - optional params

First you define your function **as above**
Then you call your function by
sayHello();

functions can return values by having **return** at the bottom. 

ex.

return num1 + num2;

*Be sure to group functions together in code
*Group function calls

Standard order is 
* Group global variables on top
* Function declarations in middle
* function calls on bottom
